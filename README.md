Introduction
This README provides information about the project we are working on. The project involves simulating UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) and their interactions with sensors and events. It utilizes Python programming language and demonstrates various concepts of software engineering.

Installation
To run this project, follow the instructions below:

Clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd your-repo
Install the required dependencies:

Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
To use this project, follow the steps below:

Open the main.py file in your preferred Python IDE.

Configure the desired settings for UAVs, sensors, and events in the code.

Run the main.py script.

The script will display the details of sensors, UAVs, and events, as well as simulate the navigation of UAVs and execution of events.

Examples
Here are some examples of the output generated by the project:

python
Copy code
# Display sensor details
print("Sensor Details:")
for sensor in sensor_details:
    sensor.display_details()
python
Copy code
# Display UAV details and paths
print("UAV Details:")
uav1.display_details()
uav2.display_details()
python
Copy code
# Run events using threads
run_events(event_details)
The above code snippets demonstrate different aspects of the project, including displaying sensor details, UAV details and paths, and running events using threads.
